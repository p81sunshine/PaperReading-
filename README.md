# Paper Reading Repository
This repository contains my personal notes and summaries of research papers I have read on topics related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

## About
I created this repository to help me keep track of and consolidate my understanding of important papers in AI/ML. Writing summaries forces me to identify key ideas and details. My goal is to read one paper a week and continually expand my knowledge.

These notes mainly serve as a personal reference but I hope they may benefit others who are interested in learning about these papers as well. Feel free to open issues or PRs if you have any feedback!
